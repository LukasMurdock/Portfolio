            Hello! My name is Jay Shin. I am a Land Grant Scholar and a sophomore at <a href="https://www.osu.edu/">The Ohio State University</a>.
            I am studying <a href="https://cse.osu.edu/">Computer Science and Engineering</a> for a Bachelor's Degree.

            While transitioning into living in America, I started running in 8th grade to make friends. We had practices everyday and meets once
            every week. I was not fast by any means, but
            I was constatnly beating my previous personal bests in every meet.
            The fact that I was making myself slighlty faster after EVERY run fascinated me,
            and made me want to train harder and test my limit. Then, I met Coach Walters. 
            <br/>
            <br/>
            I ran XC and Track and Field for Olentangy Orange High School (2016-2020), and was coached by Adam Walters, a former runner
            at Otterbein University. I increased my mileage and started having a much more organized 
            training. I worked my butt off consistently and by the time I was an upperclassman, I was running with the top dogs before
            I knew it. In my senior year, I was running
            60-65 miles a week and I honestly cared more about running than school. In a white-dominated sport, I wanted to prove that
            a nerdy Asian can invalidate the disadvantaged gene by outworking everyone. <br/><br/>

            Here are some of the notable acheivements I've made in my running career.
            I received Academic All-State Honors twice in 2019, as well as an Honorable Mention in a Conference meet. I hold a
            school record in Freshman 4x800m for my high school since 2017. <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html">Too bad I didn't have a senior season. </a>
            <br/><br/>
            

            I ran with the Ohio State Running Club for 1.5 years, but after a careful consideration, I decided to retire from running in December 2021.
            My lifetime bests are 4:38 in the mile and 16:32 in the 5K, at the age of 19.

            When I am not in school, I spend most of my time playing music. My love for music started in 2013 with a $50 acousic guitar.
            I am interested in diverse genres of music and I have particiapted in many different activities and groups in my life.

            <br/><br/>
            Guitar is my main musical instrument and I play fingerstyle guitar, specifically. 
            I am an experienced live performer as well. I have played at many open mics and weddings during high school.
            I volunteered at <a target="_blank" href="https://www.vitas.com/">VITAS Healthcare</a> for a year under the supervision of Dolores Hickman.
            I was assigned to perform at <a target="_blank" href="https://www.paramountseniorliving.com/paramount-communities/paramount-senior-living-at-westerville/">Paramount Senior Living at Westerville</a>
            every weekend.

            <br/><br/>
            I played the snare drum in my high schoool's marching band, under the direction of <a href="https://www.innovativepercussion.com/artists/craig_dunn" target="_blank">Craig Dunn</a> from <a href="https://rhythmx.org/" target="_blank">RhythmX</a>.
            After practicing 24/7, I made the snareline in my first year of drumming.
            We marched 40+ halftime shows, parades, competitions, and concerts in one semester, while practicing everyday. It was a valuable experience that
            broadened my musical knowledge, but running was more important to me at the time lol. I only played for one year.
            <br/><br/>
            I played the violin in high school's orchestra under the direction of Lori Cornett. 
            We had 4 concerts every year and participated in the <a href="https://www.omea-ohio.org">OMEA</a>'s Solo-and Ensemble Competitions,
            both as a group and individuals. I honestly didn't try very hard in orchestra, but I had a lot of fun. Oh, I was also selected to perform
            Handel's Messiah with the Columbus Symphony Orchestra.

          <p>If I can do one thing for the rest of my life, it would be composing music. The dream of my life is to become a well-known producer
            and collaborate with professional rappers. <br/><br/>
            Currently, I am the leader of a group called ERCF, 
            which is made up of passionate hiphop artists based in South Korea. As a producer, I am in charge of composing, mixing, and mastering 
            all songs released from us, as well as recruiting new artists and assisting in designing album covers. I have made 300+ beats in my career. 
            I provide support to underrepresented artists by providing instrumental tracks, linking them up with featuring artists, and releasing their songs, all for free.

             <br/><br/>

             My unique style is combining various generes of music, that has nothing to do with each other,
             into one beat. Here is my <a target="_blank" href="https://soundcloud.com/ercfminecraftboi">SoundCloud</a>.
