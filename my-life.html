            Hello! My name is Jay Shin. I am currently a Land Grant Scholar at <a href="https://www.osu.edu/">The Ohio State University</a> and just finished my 2nd year.
            I am studying <a href="https://cse.osu.edu/">Computer Science and Engineering</a> towards a Bachelor's Degree in Spring 2024.<br/><br/> At Ohio State, I work as an 
            Undergraudate Teaching Assistant for an Intro Python Programming course. During the summer, I will be working 
            at <a href="https://www.sunquestinfo.com/">Sunquest Information Systems</a> as a Software Development Engineer (SDE) Intern. I am very excited for this opportunity.
            <br/>

            I started running in 8th grade to make friends, and even though I was not fast by any means, 
            I was constatnly beating my previous personal bests in every meet.
            The fact that I was making myself a little faster after EVERY run fascinated me,
            and made me want to train harder and test my limit. Then, I met Coach Walters. 
            <br/>
            <br/>
            I ran XC and Track and Field for Orange High School (2016-2020), and was coached by Adam Walters, a former runner
            at Otterbein University. I increased my mileage and started having a much more organized 
            training. I worked my butt off and by the time I was an upperclassman, I was running with the top dogs on the varsity team before
            I knew it. In my senior year, I was running
            60-65 miles a week and I honestly cared more about running than school. In a white-dominated sport, I wanted to prove that
            a nerdy Asian can invalidate the disadvantaged gene by outworking everyone. <br/><br/>

            Here are some of the notable achevements I made throughout my running career. I made Academic All-State Honors twice 
            (XC and T&F in 2019) and All-Conference Honorable Mention in XC (2019), both in Division 1. I hold a Freshman 4x800m 
            school record for Orange High School since 2017. Lastly, I am a 8 x recipient of the Scholar Athlete Award from Orange.
            <br/><br/>

            I ran for 1.5 years with the Ohio State Running Club, but after a careful consideration, I decided to completely retire from running in December 2021.
            My lifetime bests are 4:38 in the mile and 16:32 in the 5K, at the age of 19.
