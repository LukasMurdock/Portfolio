      Hello! I am Jay Shin. I am originally from Daegu, South Korea. I moved to the United States in July, 2014.<br/>
      Until my senior of high school, I could not figure out what I was interested in. My best friend, <br/>
       Lucas Wingert (incoming SDE intern @ Amazon), encouraged me to try coding in Java... <br/>
      And then... now I am studying Computer Science and Engineering at The Ohio State University. <br/>
      I have taken many advanced classes at Ohio State, but I still feel like I don't know that much. <br/>
      My goal is to find software engineering internships throughout college and expereience a <br/>
      real-life application of computer science. That will make me be even more enthuised about this <br/>
      career and work harder to chase my goals. I plan on continously studying on my own to make myself a better coder. <br/>
      Outside of school, I have a life... A busy life... I have friends here and in Korea and a family in Korea. <br/>
      My hobbies include distance running, beatmaking, listening to hiphop, Overwatch, Comsem (before it ended) <br/>
      playing the guitar, playing the piano, rubix cube, yoyo, looking through my old photos, texting, etc. <br/>
      I spent most of my childhood making music, and if I can do 1 thing for the rest of my life, it would <br/>
      be making music. My favorite artists are NO:EL, Veinyfl, and Lil tachi.
